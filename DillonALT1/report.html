    <h1>ALT 1 Report:</h1>
    
    <p>
      This is the website report of the <em>Computer Science Leaving Cert 2020</em> ALT 1 Mock.</br>
  The goal of this brief was <strong>to make an website that contains content for the user to interact with.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>
      1. A Rationale for the Approach to the Brief 
    </h2>

    <h3>
     1.1 Research:
    </h3>
    <p>
    I used the following sources as inpiration for my mini-games:
<br> <ul>
  <li>I went to the shops and I bought...</li>
  <li>Youtube videos</li>
  <li>The stupid test</li>
</ul>

    I used websites such as:
<ul>
  <li>Khan academy</li>
  <li>W3schools.com</li>
</ul>
<br>

I also researched the ways how I could make the website appealing for my users and came up with the following features:
      <ul>
        <li>Dropdown menu</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Backround and text colour</li>
</ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
      1.2 Response to the Brief:
    </h3>
    <p>
    My initial response to the brief to use my code that I was familiar with to make a reaction game website that would test the users ability.<br>
    Over the summer, I had constructed a series of reaction games. My plan was to use these reaction games to test the user, and then to record the<br>
    scores and keep them as data in a firebase. <br>
      <br>
   I tried to lay out the website in an appealing way for the user. In order to do this I included:
      <ul>
        <li>Dropdown menu</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Backround and text colour</li>
</ul>

<br> I researched ways in which I could make the website as enjoyable as possible for the user, as I have outlined above.

<h2>
3. Design and Development of the Artefact   
</h2>


<h3>
  3.1 (a) The iterative design process:
</h3>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>I made a series of memory games using python with the initial intention to embed these systems into the website using Repl.it.</li>
<p>
  - This idea was scrapped due to the fact that Repl.it <em>did not have the package needed </em>to import firebase and therefore I would not be able to record scores 
  in my database.
    </p>
    <li>Next, I decided to try and translate all the python code into Javascript using Youtube and online scripts.</li>
    <p>
      - However I found this way to be an unefficient way to utilise the short period of time I had to complete the project,
      despite the fact it may have solved my problem eventually.
    </p>
    <li><strong>Finally</strong>, I decided to scrap the memory game and import a minigame that would give the user a score that
    they could then import to a database. </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color:red">
      Was this the best solution?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that although it may seem like an easier route, the change in plan gave me time to focus more on the user interface
      and allowed me to add in attractive features. <br>
      <em>Personally</em>, it was the most logical option given the time frame of the project. I still managed to:
      <ul>
        <li>Make a working python code which imports scores to a Firebase and reads the highest recorded score onto my website</li>
        <p>
          *code can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/dillonpalmer/alt1">here</a>*
        </p>
        <li>Construct a website containing images, dropdown menus and internal links</li>
        <li>Integrate a minigame that allows users to compete to get as high a score as possible, then allows them to send the score 
        obtained to the Firebase</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    After evaluation, I believe I effectively used my time and it ultimately worked to my advantage.
    </p>

</ul>

<h3>
  3.1 (c) Evidence of Computational Thinking:
</h3>

<img src="https://www.computationalthinkers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ComputationalThinkingProductLogo.png" height="600" width="600">

<p>
  <strong>Decomposition</strong><br>
  <br>I broke down the test into levels with increasing difficulties. At the end of each level, the programme
   determines whether the user has passed the level or not. One big <em><strong>problem</strong></em> I ran into was that if a user failed,
  the loop would have them retrying forever and ever until they passed. <em><strong>Through decomposition</strong></em>, I altered
  the program so that it allows the user to exit the game if they decide they have given up.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Pattern recognition</strong><br>
  <br>During my research, I noticed a pattern in the similiarities of each memory game I looked to for inspiration. Almost every one included
  a level which tested the reflexes of an individual and/or tested the ability of the user to retain information. <br>
  Given this pattern, it indicated that these approaches were the most popular to accurately determine the users reactions.<br>
  <br>
  
  
  <strong>Abstraction</strong><br>
  <br>
  By allowing the users to decide when they have reached their ability and giving them the power to end the game when they wish, I have 
  ultimately separated them into 3 different classes:
  <ul>
    <li>Level 1 standard reactions</li>
    <li>Level 2 standard reactions</li>
    <li>Level 3 standard reactions</li>
    
</ul>
This means that any outliers in the data would have been abstracted and put into a class with similiar ability, which would allow me
to further investigate the data according to the ability of the individuals. Therefore, I could evaluate the results more in depth for
a highly accurate result.
</p>


<h3>
  3.2 Development of the Artefact:
</h3>
<p>
  <strong>User Interface Design –</strong><br>
  <br>I chose features such as images and dropdown menus as well as colour schemes to make the user interface more attractive and
  interactive. These features make the website more enjoyable for the user and will make them more likely to use again in future.
<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Testing –</strong><br>
  <br>Firstly, I tested the programmes to debug or alter the programme where needed.<br>
  I then asked family members to test the website and give me constructive feedback on what areas I could make the user's experience better.
<br>With multiple testing and trial/error, I designed the end product that I am reporting on today.<br>
  *see 3.1 for the stepping stones of the project*
</p>

<h3>
  4. Evaluation of the artefact
</h3>
<p>
  There are certainly areas I could have spend more time on and/or improved such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Python to Javascript translation</li>
    <li>Database structure</li>
    <li>Website design and layout</li>
</ul>

<strong>HOWEVER</strong>, given the setbacks that I ran into on this project, I feel that there is a lot of good to take from this project.
I also feel I will carry a lot of knowledge on to future projects and challenges.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my ALT 1 project.
