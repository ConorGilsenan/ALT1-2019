   <h2>1. A Rationale for the Approach to the Brief </h2>
   
   <h3 class = "orange">1.1 Research</h3>
   <p>
   Before beginning our project we decided to investigate different websites to get an idea of what we can do for our own website.
   We then decided to create a game and specifically a reaction game. 
   </p>
   <br>
   <h3 class = "purple">1.2 Response to Brief</h3>
   <p>
   We decided to make a reaction speed game.
   We went with the most basic design as we wanted to make it as easy to use as possible.
   This game can be played by anyone that wants to test their reactions

   <h2>3. Design and Development of the Artefact</h2>
   
   <h3 class = "red">3.1(a) The iterative design process</h3>
   <p>
     Version 0.1 was just a blank screen with each heading.
     <br>
     Version 0.5 included the new fonts and colours
     <br>
     Version 1.0 had our first design of the reaction game
     <br>
     Version 1.5 connected our database to the website and the game had a timer at the bottom
     <br>
     Version 1.7 had a start screen for the game so it wouldnt start straight away
     <br>
     Version 1.9 added a progression bar at the top of the game
     <br>
     Version 2.0 the score that you got is sent away to a database
     <br>
     Version 2.5 the highest scores are displayed on the side 
     <br>
     Version 3.0 allowed the user to input their name
     <br>
     Version 3.5 sorted the highest score correctly and displayed the users name beside it
     <br>
     Version 3.8 corrected the size of text and position of everything 
     <br>
     Version 4.0 (Final product) shapes are now sized randomly between 70 pixels and 100 pixels
   </p>

   </p>
   
   <h3 class = "yellow"> 3.1(c) Evidence of Computational Thinking</h3>
   <p>
     Through Decomposition, we broke down the creation of our website into three basic parts: 
     <br>
     1. It has a working game
     <br>
     2. It sends the user's score to a database
     <br>
     3. It reads the scores from the database and displays them
   </p>
   
   <h3 class = "green">3.2 Development of the Artefact</h3>
   <p>
     We decided on having very little on the page as it makes the page much more understandible and easier to navigate.
     This meets many of the headings of UX Design e.g. Usability First and Less Is More
     <br>
     The website also allows the user to input their own name. 
     This fits under the heading: The User Is In Control
   </p>
   
   <h2>4. Evaluation of the artefact</h2>
   <p>
     
   </p>
   
   <h3>4.1 Artefact features</h3>
   <p>
     It has a fully functional game that has no errors
     <br>
     It successfully sends the user's score to a database
     <br>
     It allows the user to add their name for the leaderboard
     <br>
     There are no problems with expressing the top scores from the database
     <br>
     The game successfully makes the shapes a random size between 70px and 100px
     <br>
     We were unable to add other shapes as it would make the code for pressing them very long and complicated
   </p>
   
   <h3>4.2 Future Development</h3>
   <p>
     We would like to try and figure out a code that would allow us to use more shapes that are not 4 sided
     <br>
     We would also like to have the game display where you are located in the score breakdown
